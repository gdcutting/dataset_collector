# Dataset Collector Application

This is a python application that collects datasets. In the current version it is very much Work In Progress [WIP]. This initial test version uses the Kaggle API to retrieve a short list of current 'hot' (high activity) datasets and download them locally.

The eventual goal is to build the application out to incorporate a number of important python features:
- an API
- YAML configuration
- CLI interface with argument parameters
- more data sources
